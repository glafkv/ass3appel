Project 3
Author: Gabi Appel
Due Date: 10/6/2019

Purpose:
	Get familiarized with semaphores, fork, exec, and shared memory

To run:
	make 			//to compile
	./oss -h		//to open the help menu
	./oss -s <x>		//to specify the maximum number of child processes spawned. the default is 5
	./oss -l <filename>	//to choose the name of the logfile. default is logfile.txt
	./oss -t <z> 		//to choose the time in real seconds when the master will terminate itself and all the children
	make clean		//to remove all the oject and executable files

Problems:
	I think I have a memory leak somewhere, but I can't seem to figure out where. 
	When it seg faults, I used the command 'ipcrm -a' to delete all the shared memory, then I compiled it again using make and then ran it and it normally worked.
	If that didn't work, I logged out and logged back in and tried again after the above.
	Please see me if it doesn't work.
